## How to train a SR model

### Fixed scale SR model (*e.g.*, TransEnet, SRCNN, LGCNet, FSRCNN, DCM, VDSR)

Please run **"train_cnn_sr.py"**. Config is the file of **"configs/train_CNN.yaml**.

### Continuous scale SR model (*e.g.*, LIIF, MetaSR, ALIIF)

Please run **"train_liif_metasr_aliff.py"**. Config are in the folder of **"configs/baselines/"**.

### Continuous scale SR model (*e.g.*, DIINN, ArbRCAN, SADN, OverNet)

Please run **"train_diinn_arbrcan_sadn_overnet.py"**. Config is the file of **"configs/baselines/train_1x-5x_INR_diinn_arbrcan_sadn_overnet.yaml"**.

### **Our FunSR model**

Please run **"train_inr_funsr.py"** for a single GPU training or DP multi GPUs training. Config is the file of **"configs/train_1x-5x_INR_funsr.yaml"**.

üëçüëçüëç We also provide a DDP multi GPUs training method. Please refer to **"scripts/train_multi_gpus_with_ddp.py"** and **"train_inr_funsr_ddp.py"** for more details.

## How to eval a SR model

### Interpolation SR model (*e.g.*, Bilinear, Bicubic)

Please run **"test_interpolate_sr.py"**. Config is the file of **"configs/test_interpolate.yaml**.

### Fixed scale SR model (*e.g.*, TransEnet, SRCNN, LGCNet, FSRCNN, DCM, VDSR)

Please run **"test_cnn_sr.py"**. Config is the file of **"configs/test_CNN.yaml**.

### Continuous scale SR model (*e.g.*, LIIF, MetaSR, ALIIF)

Please run **"test_inr_liif_metasr_aliif.py"**. Config is the file of **"configs/baselines/test_INR_liif_metasr_aliif.yaml"**.

### Continuous scale SR model (*e.g.*, DIINN, ArbRCAN, SADN, OverNet, **FunSR**)

Please run **"test_inr_diinn_arbrcan_sadnarc_funsr_overnet.py"**. Config is the file of **"configs/test_INR_diinn_arbrcan_funsr_overnet.yaml"**.

üëçüëçüëç We also provide a script to evaluate multi upscale factors in a batch. Please refer to **"scripts/test_script.py"** for more details.

## Result visualization

We provide some visualization tools to show the reconstruction results in our paper. Please refer to the folder **"tools/paper_vis_tools"** for more details.
