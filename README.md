## Model Training

### SAM-based Model

#### Config File and Main Parameter Parsing

We provide the configuration files of the SAM-based models used in the paper, which can be found in the `configs/rsprompter` folder. The Config file is completely consistent with the API interface and usage method of MMDetection. Below we provide an analysis of some of the main parameters. If you want to know more about the meaning of the parameters, you can refer to the [MMDetection documentation](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/user_guides/config.html).

<details>

**Parameter Parsing**:

- `work_dir`: The output path of model training, which generally does not need to be modified.
- `default_hooks-CheckpointHook`: Checkpoint saving configuration during model training, which generally does not need to be modified.
- `default_hooks-visualization`: Visualization configuration during model training, **comment out during training and uncomment during testing**.
- `vis_backends-WandbVisBackend`: Configuration of network-side visualization tools, **after opening the comment, you need to register an account on the `wandb` official website, and you can view the visualization results during training in the web browser**.
- `num_classes`: The number of categories in the dataset, **which needs to be modified according to the number of categories in the dataset**.
- `prompt_shape`: The shape of the Prompt, the first parameter represents $N_p$, and the second parameter represents $K_p$, which generally does not need to be modified.
- `hf_sam_pretrain_name`: The name of the SAM model on HuggingFace Spaces, which generally does not need to be modified.
- `hf_sam_pretrain_ckpt_path`: The checkpoint path of the SAM model on HuggingFace Spaces, **which needs to be modified to your own path**, you can use the [download script](https://github.com/KyanChen/RSPrompter/blob/release/tools/rsprompter/download_hf_sam_pretrain_ckpt.py) to download.
- `model-decoder_freeze`: Whether to freeze the parameters of the SAM decoder, which generally does not need to be modified.
- `model-neck-feature_aggregator-hidden_channels`: The hidden channel number of the feature aggregator, which generally does not need to be modified.
- `model-neck-feature_aggregator-select_layers`: The number of layers selected by the feature aggregator, **which needs to be modified according to the selected SAM backbone type**.
- `model-mask_head-with_sincos`: Whether to use sin regularization when predicting prompts, which generally does not need to be modified.

### Other Instance Segmentation Models

<details>

If you want to use other instance segmentation models, you can refer to [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/main) to train the models, or you can put their Config files in the `configs` folder of this project, and then train them according to the above methods.

</details>

## Model Testing

python demo/image_demo.py ${IMAGE_FILE}  configs/rsprompter/xxx.py --weights ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} --out-dir ${OUTPUT_DIR}  # IMAGE_FILE is the image file you want to predict, xxx.py is the configuration file you want to use, CHECKPOINT_FILE is the checkpoint file you want to use, OUTPUT_DIR is the output path of the prediction result
```

#### Multi-image Prediction:

```shell
python demo/image_demo.py ${IMAGE_DIR}  configs/rsprompter/xxx.py --weights ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} --out-dir ${OUTPUT_DIR}  # IMAGE_DIR is the image folder you want to predict, xxx.py is the configuration file you want to use, CHECKPOINT_FILE is the checkpoint file you want to use, OUTPUT_DIR is the output path of the prediction result
```


## Common Problems

<details>

We have listed some common problems and their corresponding solutions here. If you find that some problems are missing, please feel free to provide PR to enrich this list. If you cannot get help here, please use [issue](https://github.com/KyanChen/RSPrompter/issues) to seek help. Please fill in all the required information in the template, which will help us locate the problem faster.

### 1. Do I need to install MMDetection?

We recommend that you do not install MMDetection because we have made some modifications to the code of MMDetection, which may cause errors in the code if you install MMDetection. If you encounter an error that the module has not been registered, please check:

- Whether MMDetection is installed, if so, uninstall it
- Whether `@MODELS.register_module()` is added in front of the class name, if not, add it
- Whether `from .xxx import xxx` is added in `__init__.py`, if not, add it
- Whether `custom_imports = dict(imports=['mmdet.rsprompter'], allow_failed_imports=False)` is added in the Config file, if not, add it

### 2. How to evaluate the model after training with DeepSpeed?

We recommend that you use DeepSpeed to train the model because DeepSpeed can greatly improve the training speed of the model. However, the training method of DeepSpeed is different from that of MMDetection, so after using DeepSpeed to train the model, you need to use the method of MMDetection to evaluate it. Specifically, you need to:

- Convert the model trained by DeepSpeed to the model of MMDetection, enter the folder where the model is stored, and run

```shell
python zero_to_fp32.py . $SAVE_CHECKPOINT_NAME -t $CHECKPOINT_DIR  # $SAVE_CHECKPOINT_NAME is the name of the converted model, $CHECKPOINT_DIR is the name of the model trained by DeepSpeed
``` 
- Change `runner_type` in the Config file to `Runner`.
- Use the method of MMDetection to evaluate, and you can get the evaluation results.

Note: Low-resolution input images can effectively reduce the memory usage of the model, but their actual performance has not been verified. For details, please refer to [Config file](configs/rsprompter/rsprompter_query-nwpu-peft-512.py).

### 4. Solution to dist_train.sh: Bad substitution

If you encounter the error `Bad substitution` when running `dist_train.sh`, please use `bash dist_train.sh` to run the script.
